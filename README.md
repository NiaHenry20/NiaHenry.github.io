Secrets is a Journal Entry website that allows users to create &amp; store personal journals with customized covers. Users can create multiple journals, each with its own unique title. Entries are private and stored for later use and viewing. It's a great way to document one's thoughts, feelings and experiences. The website is now live and ready for the world to use, come and check it out! </a>

<h1> How it was built </h1>
The program was developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Railway, and GitHub Pages. HTML provided the foundational structure of the website, while CSS enhanced its appearance with visual styling. JavaScript introduced interactivity and dynamic features to the user experience. Node.js powered the backend logic, enabling seamless integration with the front end via Railway. Railway was instrumental in managing APIs, simplifying the process of connecting to data sources, creating endpoints, and accessing data globally. MongoDB securely stored user-submitted information, ensuring it could be retrieved at any time. Finally, GitHub Pages was used to host the website. Below is a comprehensive list of all the technologies utilized:
<ul>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Nodejs</li>
<li>HTML/CSS</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>

<h1> The Design </h1>
To design the user interface for Secrets, I utilized Adobe Illustrator's powerful features. By combining tools like the pen tool, shapes, and color palettes, I crafted a visually appealing and user-friendly design. The final product was a sleek, modern layout that effectively conveyed the journaling concept while delivering an intuitive user experience. The UI design created in Illustrator served as a blueprint for the website's front-end development, ensuring a cohesive aesthetic and a seamless user experience across the platform.
