Secrets is a Journal Entry website that allows users to create &amp; store personal journals with customized covers. Users can create multiple journals, each with its own unique title. Entries are private and stored for later use and viewing.

<h1> The Design </h1>
To design the user interface for Secrets, I employed Adobe Illustrator to create an intuitive and visually engaging layout. Using tools like the pen tool, shapes, and color palettes, I developed a modern, streamlined design that captured the essence of journaling while delivering a smooth user experience. The design served as a blueprint for front-end development, ensuring a unified aesthetic and consistent user journey throughout the platform.
