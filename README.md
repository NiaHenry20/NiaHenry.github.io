# Secrets, A Journal Entry Website!
<img src="/images/artbmain-23.png" alt="Alt text" title="Optional title">
Secrets is a Journal Entry website that allows users to create &amp; store personal journals with customized covers. Users can create multiple journals, each with its own unique title. Entries are private and stored for later use and viewing. It's a great way to document one's thoughts, feelings and experiences. <a href = https://abdelrahmanmerdan.github.io/Secrets-Journal-Entry/> The website is now live and ready for the world to use, come and check it out! </a>

<h1> How it was built </h1>
The program was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Railway app and GitHub Pages. HTML provided the basic structure of the website, CSS was used to style the page and make it visually appealing, JavaScript was used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website. Node.js was used to build the backend logic of the website and connect it to the front-end using Railway app. Railway app was utilized to manage my own APIs, it made it simple to connect to data sources, create endpoints, and access the data from anywhere in the world. MongoDB was used to store the information sent by the user in a secure place where it can be accessed at any time. Finally, I used GitHub Pages to host the website. The full list of everything used is below:
<ul>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Nodejs</li>
<li>HTML/CSS</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Railway app</li>
<li>Github Pages</li>
<li>Adobe Suite</li>
</ul>

<h1> The Design </h1>
In the creation of the user interface design for Secrets, I leveraged the capabilities of Adobe Illustrator. I employed a combination of the software's tools, such as the pen tool, shapes, and color palettes, to produce a visually appealing and intuitive design. The end result was a streamlined, contemporary layout that effectively communicated the journaling concept while providing a seamless user experience. The UI design generated in Illustrator served as a blueprint for the website's front-end development, ensuring a consistent aesthetic and user experience throughout the platform.
